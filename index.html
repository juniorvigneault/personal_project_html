        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p class="section-paragraph"> I'm currently a student at McGill School of Continuing Studies pursuing a
          certificate in full-stack
          development. In 2019, I obtained a certificate in digital music from the University of Montreal.
          <br>
          <br>
          My interests lie in creative development using JavaScript libraries, particularly Three.js. I'm also
          fascinated by physical computing and material interaction, and I'm constantly seeking new opportunities to
          explore these areas. While I'm still in the process of building my professional experience, I'm eager to take
          on challenges and collaborate with others to develop innovative solutions.</p>
